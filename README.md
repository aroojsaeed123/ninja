Q:Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
#Artemis Financial is a financial consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for savings, retirement, 
#investments, and insurance for their patrons.As an important step in Artemis Financial’s desire to modernize its operations and as a crucial 
#part of the success of their custom software, they want to implement and apply the most current and effective software security. 
#Artemis Financial has a public web interface and is seeking Global Rain’s expertise in taking steps to protect their client data and financial information.
Q: What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security 
add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
#As the Artemis financial has to keep their user information secure, this cipher will help them to keep the data safe from all the security attacks. 
#After reviewing the code manually, we need to focus more on securing user input as it is the basic and far most important thing. 
#We also need to have secure client and server relationship in order to protect our companies policies. 
#This cipher is used in the form of ciphertext and decode the data back to its original shape. The ciphertext secure the information of our clients from getting leaked or stolen. 
Q:What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
#The process was really challenging at first but then I used all the resources and tried my best to solve the issue.
Q:How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities 
and determine mitigation techniques?
#We also need to have secure client and server relationship in order to protect our companies policies. 
#This cipher is used in the form of ciphertext and decode the data back to its original shape. The ciphertext secure the information of our clients from getting leaked or stolen.
Q: How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
#i checked the code through functionality checking.
Q: What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
#The use of cipher is helpful for the company.
Q:Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. 
What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
#I have created a project that finds Algorithm Cipher, generate Certificate Generation, check Secure Communications, and did secondary and functionality testing.
