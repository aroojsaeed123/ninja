This project is a complete package of Artemis Financial (a financial consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for savings, retirement, 
investments, and insurance for their patrons).

In this project, created a cipher that will help them to keep the data safe from all the security attacks. This cipher is used in the form of ciphertext and decode the data back to its original shape. The ciphertext secure the information of our clients from getting leaked or stolen. I have created a project that finds Algorithm Cipher, generate Certificate Generation, check Secure Communications, and did secondary and functionality testing.
